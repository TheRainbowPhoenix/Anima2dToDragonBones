# Unity Anima2D Scene Parser
Read a "*.unity" (currently hardcoded to `Base1.unity`) file and get the drawing order (currently limited to GameObject named after a specific character) and apply them to the DragonBones project

Currently, apply the DrawingOrder correctly and updates image positions.

> Note: A `SCALE_FACTOR` of 100 have been used to convert texture from Unity to DragonBones. Also, the Y axis seems to be inverted.
